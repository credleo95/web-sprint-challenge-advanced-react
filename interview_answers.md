Be prepared to demonstrate your understanding of this week's concepts by answering questions on the following topics. These will not be counted as a part of your sprint score but will be helpful for preparing you for your endorsement interview, and enhancing overall understanding.

1. What are the main differences between a stateful and a functional component?
   The difference between the two types of components is best explained by saying that state allows a component to accept a wide varitey of actively changing values all stored within variables in state. Whereas, functional components that are stateless can only accept properties that are passed down.

    A componenentWillMount function is called just before mounting occurs. Then, the componentWillUpdate is called before the rendering phase.
